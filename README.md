Project Description: Code Snippet Web API (Node.js + Express)
This project is a simple yet powerful Code Snippet Storage Web API built using Node.js and Express. It allows users to store, update, retrieve, search, and delete their code snippets efficiently. The API is designed with a RESTful approach, making it straightforward to integrate with both backend and frontend applications.

Key Features
User-Centric Storage:
Each user can create and manage their personal collection of code snippets, organized by snippet names.

CRUD Operations:

Create/Update: Easily add new snippets or update existing ones using a single endpoint.

Retrieve Single: Fetch a specific snippet by name for a user.

List All: View all snippets belonging to a user.

Delete: Remove any snippet by name from a userâ€™s collection.

Keyword Search:
Users can search their snippets by keywords contained in either the snippet name or code content, making it easy to find relevant code quickly.

Timestamps for Tracking:
Every snippet records its creation and last updated times, providing clear change tracking.

RESTful API Design:
Adhering to REST standards ensures clear separation between creation, retrieval, update, and deletion operations, which improves clarity, maintainability, and scalability.
